# Simple Location-Based Flutter App

This app is a simple Flutter application that allows users to input a location and displays it on a map. It consists of two main screens: a location input screen and a map display screen. The app demonstrates handling user input, integrating with map services, and implementing basic state management.

## Features

- **Location Input Screen**: Users can enter a location by name, address, or coordinates. This screen includes input validation to ensure the location field is not left empty.
- **Map Display Screen**: Displays the user’s entered location on a map with a marker.
- **Map Types**: Users can switch between standard, satellite, and terrain map views.
- **Current Location**: An optional feature that detects and displays the user’s current location.
